            <p>Queen is a very legendary english rock band that was founded in 1970. 
                Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon.</p>
            <p>In 1968 guitarist Brian May and singer-bassist Tim Staffel decided to form a band. 
                They searched for a drummer and a guy called Roger Taylor got that job. 
                That band called itself Smile. 
                Staffel left the Smile in 1970 and the band didn’t have singer anymore. 
                Then Brian’s and Roger’s friend Freddie Mercury joined them. 
                Freddie suggested forming a new band and Queen was born. 
                In the first months of Queen it had a lot of bassists who did not fit into the band. 
                Finally they found John Deacon. 
                On July 1971 Queen played their first show in the classic line-up.</p>
