                Queen is a very iconic english rock band that was formed in 1970. 
                Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon.

                In 1968 guitarist Brian May and singer-bassist Tim Staffel decided to form a band. They 
                searched for a drummer and a guy called Roger Taylor got that job. They called themselves 
                itself Smile. Staffel left the Smile in 1970 and the band didnâ€™t have singer anymore. 
                Then Smile's big fan Freddie Mercury joined them. He suggested forming a new band and 
                Queen was born. In the first months of Queen it had a lot of bassists who did not fit 
                into the band. Finally they found John Deacon. On July 1971 Queen played their first show 
                in the classic line-up.

                Queen's popularity grew slowly but surely in the early 1970s until their blockbuster 
                song, Bohemian Rhapsody (1975), made Queen one of the most popular rock bands.

                Freddie Mercury was born as Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar on September 1946. 
                In 1964 he fled with his family from Zanzibar to England.

                Freddie wasn't very good at school. He didn't pass several courses and didn't succeed in 
                his short-term employments. Luckily Freddie had a large vocal range and very flamboyant 
                singing style because they made him a famous singer. He wasn't only a great singer 
                but also a good piano player.

                From the early days of Queen, Mercury was an exceptionally spectacular stage performer 
                both in his dressing, make-up and movement. 
            </p>

                In 1970 Freddie met Mary Austin. After their separation in 1977, Freddie started a whole 
                homosexual life, which involved hundreds of affairs and roaming in gay clubs 
                over the coming years. In those days he also started using cocaine. Freddie lived his 
                last six years with Jim Hutton. He died of AIDS in 1991.
